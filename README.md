# Aid of a machine learning algorithm can improve clinician predictions of patient quality of life during breast cancer treatments

This is a hub to host the research code of modeling quality of life of breast cancer patients.

## Introduction
Proper and well-timed interventions may improve breast cancer patient adaptation and quality of life (QoL) through treatment and recovery. The challenge is to identify those patients who would benefit most from a particular intervention. Our aim was to measure whether the machine learning prediction incorporated in the clinical decision support system (CDSS) improves clinicians’ performance to predict patients’ QoL during treatment process. 

## Dataset
Data for the study were collected in seven waves: baseline (3-4 weeks post-diagnosis) and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after the baseline. The data collection process and strategy is described in details in [1]. Each data collection wave comprised a set of specific measures able to capture changes in specific domains. Variables can be classified into three domains: (1) sociodemographic and lifestyle, (2) medical and treatment-related and (3) psychosocial.
